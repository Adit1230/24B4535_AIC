I want to join AI community because I am very interested in AI and ML and I want to learn more about it. I want to go into research in the field of AI. I want to build AI models that are practical and useful and have a good impact on the world. I feel joining AI community would be very helpful for this purpose. I have learnt python in 11th and 12th grade. I have experience in using libraries like numpy, pandas, matplotlib, pytorch, tensorflow, scikit learn, etc. I have participated in Winter of Data Science bootcamp and done a project on Speech Recognition. I also have knowledge of various concepts in ML and deep learning such as linear regression, neural networks, CNNs, RNNs, LSTMs, transformers, etc. I have done a project on building neural networks from scratch using only numpy when I was in 11th grade. I am also part of the AI subdivision of The Humanoid Project tech team. I hope to join this community, contribute to it, build AI models, participate in hackathons and represent our institute. I hope to contribute to the student community by building models that are useful to them in daily life. I want to learn more about AI and apply this knowledge practically.
